Notes on how to SSH into GBT_SCA Raspberry Pi
----------------------------------------------

As the Raspberry Pi(RPi) boots it will create a wifi named GBT_SCA_Wifi. Wait sometime for the RPi to boot(Even after the SSID shows up in the Wifi List)


Login to GBT_SCA_Wifi using the password tHMpCE`J

Once logged in you can ssh into the system using 

ssh pi@192.168.4.1

Username : pi
Password : Rasp-Berry-!2#


For Flashing Firmware (After you ssh into GBT_SCA RPi)
----------------------------------------------

cd Flash_Firmware
./compile
sudo ./NexFlash.exe < *HEX_File*

where *HEX_File* is the Hex file that you want to flash to the Nexys Video Memory



Firmwares Available in folder ~/Flash_Firmware/HEX_Files/ :

2018_8_27_GBT_SCA_Comm_v1.hex --> for testing GBT_SCA; capable of sending packets

2018_8_9_RCB_LedTest_Nex1.hex --> for testing connections in the board



Note: You need to power cycle (or click "PROG" button)  Nexys board for the firmware to load


Things in the works:

Flash 2018_8_27_GBT_SCA_Comm_v1 and:

--> Use GBT_SCA.c to set pattern through the Remote SCA Board

--> Use sca_blink.c to make the led on GBT SCA blink. (still needs some packet modifications)
