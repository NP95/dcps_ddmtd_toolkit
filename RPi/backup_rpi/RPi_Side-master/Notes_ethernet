There is no option in iptables which will make your rules permanent. But you can use iptables-save and iptables-restore to fulfill your task.

First add the iptable rule using the command you gave.

Then save iptables rules to some file like /etc/iptables.conf using following command:

$  iptables-save > /etc/iptables.conf
Add the following command in /etc/rc.local to reload the rules in every reboot.

$  iptables-restore < /etc/iptables.conf
